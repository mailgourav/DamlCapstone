### II. Actors

  7. evaluator exercises Evaluate and decides that it's ready to be published - an Accomplishment contract is created

### III. Challenge(s)
* `controller ... can` syntax causes warning in Daml 2.0+. The code itself does not cause any issues/errors in 2.5.0 but according to the warning, the syntax will be deprecated in the future versions of Daml. More information [here](https://docs.daml.com/daml/reference/choices.html#daml-ref-controller-can-deprecation).
* The new controller syntax requires a controller to be an observer first before they can exercise a choice, otherwise it'll throw an error: "Attempt to fetch or exercise a contract not visible to the committer." For more information, check out [this post](https://discuss.daml.com/t/error-attempt-to-fetch-or-exercise-a-contract-not-visible-to-the-committer/1304/1) on the Daml Forum.
* The project was created by using `empty-skeleton` and the following was removed from `daml.yaml`:
```
sandbox-options:
   - --wall-clock-time
```
and the following was added:

```
exposed-modules:
  - Main
```
